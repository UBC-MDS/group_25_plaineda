    "text": "Welcome to your shiny new package. This page will help you get started with using Hatch to manage your package.\nIf you look at your project, you will see that a pyproject.toml file. This file stores both your package configuration and settings for development tools like Hatch that you will use to work on your package.\nThis file is written using a .toml format. You can learn more about toml here. Here’s the TL&DR:\n\nEach [] section in the toml file is called a table.\nYou can nest tables with double brackets like this[[]]\nTables contain information about a element that you want to configure.\n\nWe are using Hatch as the default packaging tool. Hatch allows you to configure and run environments and scripts similar to workflow tools like tox or nox.\nHach, by default, uses virtual environments (venv) to manage environments. But you can configure it to use other environment tools.Read the hatch documentation to learn more about environments.\nFor this template, we have set up Hatch environments for you to use. At the bottom of your pyproject.toml file, notice a hatch environment section that looks like this:\n########################################\n# Hatch Environments\n########################################\nBelow is the Hatch environment to install your package. Notice that it defines pip and twine as two packages that the environment needs.\n[tool.hatch.envs.build]\ndescription = \"\"\"Test the installation the package.\"\"\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"pip\",\n    \"twine\",\n]\nThe table below defines the scripts that you will run build and check your package.\n[tool.hatch.envs.build.scripts]\ncheck = [\n    \"pip check\",\n    \"hatch build {args:--clean}\",\n    \"twine check dist/*\",\n]\ndetached = true\nYou can enter that environment to check it out:\n$ hatch shell build\nIf you run pip list, in the environment, twine will be there:\n$ pip list\nHatch by default, installs your package in editable mode (-e) into its virtual environments. But if detached=True is set, then it will skip installing your package into the virtual enviornment.\n\n\nBelow you see the Hatch environment test table.\ntool.hatch.envs says, “Hey, Hatch, this is the definition for an environment.” test is the name of the environment.\nThe environment below defines the dependencies that Hatch needs to install into the environment named test.\n[tool.hatch.envs.test]\ndescription = \"\"\"Run the test suite.\"\"\"\ndependencies = [\n    \"pytest\",\n    \"pytest-cov\",\n    \"pytest-raises\",\n    \"pytest-randomly\",\n    \"pytest-xdist\",\n]\nTo enter a Hatch environment use:\nhatch shell environmentname\nSo you can enter the test environment above with:\nhatch shell test\n\n\n\nIf the environment has a matrix associated with it, that tells Hatch to run the test scripts across different Python versions.\n[[tool.hatch.envs.test.matrix]]\npython = [\"3.10\", \"3.11\", \"3.12\", \"3.13\"]\nIf you run hatch shell test, you will see the output below. To enter an environment with a matrix attached to it, you need to pick the Python environment version that you want to open.\n$ hatch shell test                           \nEnvironment `test` defines a matrix, choose one of the following instead:\n\ntest.py3.10\ntest.py3.11\ntest.py3.12\ntest.py3.13\nOpen the Python 3.13 environment like this:\n$ hatch shell test.py3.13\nTo leave an environment use:\n$ deactivate\n\n\n\nIn the tests section of your pyproject.toml, you will see a tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts table.\nThis table defines the commands that you want Hatch to run in the test environment. Notice that the script has one command called run.\n[tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]\nrun = \"pytest {args:--cov=greatproject --cov-report=term-missing}\"\nTo run this script , use:\nhatch run test:run\n\nhatch run: calls Hatch and tells it that it will be running a command\ntest:run: defines the environment you want it to run (test) and defines the name of the “script” to berun.\n\nIf you have a Hatch matrix setup for tests, it will both install the necessary Python version using UV and run your tests on each version of the Python versions that you declare in the matrix table. In this case, there are 4 Python versions in the environment, so your tests will run 4 times, once in each Python version listed in the matrix table.\n@lwasser ➜ /workspaces/pyopensci-scipy25-create-python-package (main) $ hatch run test:run\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── test.py3.10 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n==================================================================== test session starts ====================================================================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.10.16, pytest-8.4.1, pluggy-1.6.0\nUsing --randomly-seed=1490740387\nrootdir: /workspaces/pyopensci-scipy25-create-python-package\nconfigfile: pyproject.toml\ntestpaths: tests\nplugins: xdist-3.8.0, randomly-3.16.0, raises-0.11, cov-6.2.1\ncollected 2 items                                                                                                                                           \n\ntests/system/test_import.py .
