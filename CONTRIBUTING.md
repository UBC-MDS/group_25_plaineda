# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome here, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Milestone Tasks

All tasks directly pertaining to project milestone instructions will be partitioned
among group members during weekly meetings and assigned via GitHub issues within the
project repository. Once assigned, group members will complete tasks locally before
pushing progress to new branches designated for their respective task(s). As tasks are
completed, group members will then create pull requests for their task branch, allowing
progress and potential merge conflicts to be evaluated by the remainder of the group.
Fellow group members will provide feedback on pull requests, determining whether or
not to immediately accept the changes to the project.

## Bug Fixes

Due to the time-sensitive nature of this project, debugging may occur on a case-by-case
basis. In the case that an issue is identified, the group member who uncovers it is
encouraged to communicate it to the rest of the group. They are also permitted to begin
implementing the fix locally, time permitting. If they are unable to complete the fix
for any reason (time, ability, illness, etc), the group will deliberate over who is best
suited to fulfill the task. Any and all fixes should be implemented using the same
branch/pull request workflow outlined for Milestone Tasks.

## Incrimental/Miscellaneous Improvements

As general areas of potential improvement are identified, group members will communicate
proposed changes to the group to allow for feedback. If it is decided that changes are to
be made, then the group will decide how to organize the completion of said changes.
Again, all changes to the project should follow a branch/pull request workflow.
